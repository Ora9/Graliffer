# Graliffer

**Graliffer** is an exotic programming language using a 2d grid holding code and data

Each cells in the grid can contain up to 3 chars (unicode graphems)

## Roadmap

- Good visual editor, with everything included, copy-paste, selection, marker for relative address and pointers (for ease of duplicating or moving code), undo mechanism, address pick and construction
- Good debuging utilities, stack visualisation, breakpoints, step-by-step ...
- Examples, templates ..
- Differents I/O, textual, graphical, sound...
- Other type of operand, with an absurdly high base for counting higher than 999, using unicode
- Paralellisation with multiples heads
